= Deploy the Application to OpenShift using Maven

To deploy the application using Maven, launch:

The first command creates an PostgreSQL database.
This database is epehemeral, so the data is lost if you stop the database.
// The data does not persist if the database is stopped.

[source,bash]
--
oc new-app \
 -p POSTGRESQL_USER=luke \
 -p POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD=secret \
 -p POSTGRESQL_DATABASE=my_data \
 -p DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=my-database \
 --name=my-database \
 --template=postgresql-ephemeral
--

The second command builds and deploys the application to the OpenShift instance on which you are logged in.

// better way to say this?
The database credentials are stored in an OpenShift secret deployed during the application deployment.

[source,bash]
--
mvn fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
--

Wait for the deployment process to complete.
