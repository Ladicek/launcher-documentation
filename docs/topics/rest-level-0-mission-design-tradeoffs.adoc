|====================================================================
|Pros           |Cons
a|
* This booster enables fast prototyping.
* The API Design is flexible.
* HTTP endpoints allow clients to be language agnostic.
a|
* As an application or service matures, the {name-mission-http-api} approach may not scale well. It may not
support a clean API design or use cases with database interactions.
** Any operations involving shared, mutable state must be integrated with an appropriate backing datastore.
** All requests handled by this API design are scoped only to the container servicing the request.
Subsequent requests may not be served by the same container.
