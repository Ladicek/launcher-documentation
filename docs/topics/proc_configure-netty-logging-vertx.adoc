= Configuring Netty Logging

link:http://netty.io/wiki/user-guide-for-4.x.html[_Netty_^] is a library used by VertX to manage asynchronous network communication in applications.

Netty:

* allows quick and easy development of network applications, such as protocol servers and clients,
* simplifies and streamlines network programming, such as TCP and UDP socket server development,
* provides a unified API for

Netty does not rely on an external logging configuration using system properties.
Instead, it implements a logging configuration based on logging libraries visible to Netty classes in your project:

* use `SLF4J` library if it is visible

* otherwise use `Log4j` if it is visible

* as a fallback option, use java.util.logging

You can force the logger to use a specific implementation by setting Nettyâ€™s internal logger implementation directly to `io.netty.util.internal.logging.InternalLoggerFactory`:

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
--
// Force logging to Log4j
InternalLoggerFactory.setDefaultFactory(Log4JLoggerFactory.INSTANCE);
