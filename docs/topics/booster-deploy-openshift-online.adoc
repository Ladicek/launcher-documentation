= Deploy your Booster to {OpenShiftOnline}

== Deploy Using the `oc` CLI Client

You can deploy your booster to {OpenShiftOnline} by following the same process in xref:deploy-booster-osl-cli[], but instead of using the {OpenShiftLocal}, use your {OpenShiftOnline} URL to access the Web console and with the `oc` CLI client. You will also need to get your authentication token for using the `oc` CLI client with your {OpenShiftLocal} account. You can find this in the link:{link-oso-console-cli-token}[{OpenShiftOnline} Web console^].
