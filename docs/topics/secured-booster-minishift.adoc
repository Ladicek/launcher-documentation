= Configuring Your {OpenShiftLocal}
Before you can run the Secured booster, you must update your {OpenShiftLocal} from the default configuration. 
You only need to do this once for any of the secured mission boosters.
They all share the same {RHSSO}/{OpenShiftLocal} setup.

Before you can use your {OpenShiftLocal}, you need to have it installed, configured, and running. You can find details on installing a {OpenShiftLocal} for your platform in link:{link-launcher-openshift-local-install-guide}#installing-a-openshiftlocal[{minishift-installation-guide-name}].

.Updating your {OpenShiftLocal} from the default Configuration

{RHSSO} will not start up unless you switch from the default configuration. The SSO booster currently only works with the CentOS base image. If you have already run the `minishift` command with a different memory setting and iso-url value,
you need to stop it and completely delete the `~/.minishift` directory before running the startup sequence.

. Delete the current {OpenShiftLocal} configuration and restart it with a new ISO.

$ rm -r ~/.minishift
$ minishift start --memory=6144 --iso-url=centos
